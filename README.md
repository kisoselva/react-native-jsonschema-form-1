react-native-jsonschema-form
============================

A simple [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) component capable of building forms  out of a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/).

Based on the great [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form).

## About
This is a fork of [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form). The difference is in the tests, made with [react-test-renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html), and React Native components instead of HTML ones.

## Thanks
To all [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) contributors!
